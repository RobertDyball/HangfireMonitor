# HangfireMonitor
ASP.Net Core + Hangfire + SignalR

An experiment, use at your own risk.

ASP.Net Core currently running at version 1.1
SignalR is not due until ASP.Net Core 1.2, however early test releases are available.
Hangfire is available already for ASP.Net Core.

Wondered how an app would look that ran Hangfire under ASP.Net core, using SignalR to let an Angular front end know when along running job had finished.

That's where this is heading.
